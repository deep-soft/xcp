//! Support for pluggable copy drivers.
//!
//! Two drivers are currently supported:
//! * `parfile`: Parallelise copying at the file level. This can improve
//!   speed on modern NVME devices, but can bottleneck on larger files.
//! * `parblock`: Parallelise copying at the block level. Block-size is
//!   configurable. This can have better performance for large files,
//!   but has a higher overhead.
//!
//! Drivers are configured with the [Config] struct. A convenience
//! function [load_driver()] is provided to load a dynamic-dispatched
//! instance of each driver.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! See the example in top-level module.
